# Project 2 Evaluation
Great work on this project. You have used one-to-one and one-to-many associations. Using Paperclip to upload images was done successfully, and is considered an advanced feature. You followed conventions in nearly all of the app.
The app was missing proper documentation. You haven't edited the README.md file, and didn't include the ERD or a link to the screencast in the README.

## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
>Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class

## Creativity and Interface
**3: Excelling**
>The app is fully responsive, incorporates outside technologies such as Flexbox. App incorporates modern UI themes, and adds unique flair.

## Code Quality
**3: Excelling**
>No major code quality issues, makes use of Ruby best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation

## Deployment and Functionality
**3: Excelling**
>App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc. App may be deployed to a service other than Heroku (e.g. Digital Ocean).

## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application
